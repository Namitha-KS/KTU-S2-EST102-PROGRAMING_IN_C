Sequential file access is the method employed in tape drives where the files are accessed in a sequential manner. So if you have to get a file in the end of the tape you have to start from the beginning till it reaches the beginning of the file.

Random access files are similar to the one in Hard Disks and Optical drives, wherever the files is placed it will go to that particular place and retrieve it.

Accessing data sequentially is much faster than accessing it randomly because of the way in which the disk hardware works.
